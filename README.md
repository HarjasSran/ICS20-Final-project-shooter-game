#ABOUT THE PROJECT
This is a project which I have completed on for my Grade 10 project for my first ever programming class.
#MY GOALS
I will continue to attemp to fix a couple of bugs in this game and make it better. I will also now use this game to help myself relearn about GUI in Python to help with some other projects of mine
#HOW TO PLAY
On the starting menu, you will be greated with a couple of messages. One of them being "Press space to start playing", after you press the space bar you will continue onto the game and more instructions will continue to follow.
Each round gives the player 3 lives, if you lose all of these lives in one round, the player will be out. If you move onto the next round, you will regain to 3 lives. To move onto the next round, the player must demolish all the blocks on the screen.
